Introduction to Db concepts:
#️⃣ Relational Db 
--> here data is stored in structured format 
means in the form of tables.

e.g. 

customers 
--------------
cus. Id     firstname     lastname   address 
1              Kiran        shinde    sadale
2              Utkuu        Ghatage   pargaon  
3              Meow         Manjar     ""

orders 
----------
order_id  item    price     cust_id
1          oil      230       1
2          powder   100       2
.
.

now in order to know that, which customer have place which order, we will connect customer id and order id.

so, cusotmer id will work as a primary key for customers table, and foreign key for orders table.
