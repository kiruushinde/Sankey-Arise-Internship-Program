#️⃣ Stored routine
    it is a sql statement or a set of statements that are stored on database server and called no. of times.

    They are of two types 
    - Stored Procedure 
    - user defined function 

----------------------------------------------------

✨ syntax 

// delete if already exists 
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXITST p_name;

now ususlly we use ; as a delimeter to end the line, but while declaring the procedures we need to change it to "$$";

// chage delimeter
DELIMETER $$

// now you can define the procedcure as follows 
CREATE PROCEDURE p_name()
BEGIN 
    select * from employees
    limit 10;
END$$ 

// again change the delimeter to semicolon
DELIMETER ;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

what ever you write between the begin and end, is your stored procedure.
