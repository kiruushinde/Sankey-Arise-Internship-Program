#️⃣ What are views 
--> let suppose you only want to see the employee's name then you won't show his salary or other details.

or consider a person who only want to see the loan number but don't want to see the load amount

therefore we can create a virtual relation, where only some portion of a table can be showed to the person, we can store this portion of a table in a virtual relation.
so, without need of writing sql query, we can access this virtual relation.

This virtual relation is called as "View".

❇️ we can provide a limited access to the database.
❇️ selective portion of a tables form one or more relations 

- they do not exits physically
- they do not have their own data.
- store complex queries


#️⃣ if we do any modification in a virtual relation (CURD) then it will affect the actual relation.

#️⃣ views are stored in data dictionary called user_views.

#️⃣ how to create view 

--> create view view_name as <query expression>

    e.g. create view v as 
            select firstname, lastname from students where [condition]; 
        
        (here 2nd line is query expression).

e.g. creat a view (loan-customer) consisting all loan customers, and thier loan numbers.

> creat view loan-customer as 
    select customer_name, loan_amount from borrower inner join loan.


now you can further use this view as 

> select * from loan-cusotmer;

#️⃣ drop view 

view can be deleted by using below command 

drop view view_name;
