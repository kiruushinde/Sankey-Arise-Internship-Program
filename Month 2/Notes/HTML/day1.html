 what is html ?
 - Hyper Text Markup Language

 it is not a programmign language.

 but, a markup language -> meaning that we make use of tags to display the information.

 tags like <p>, <img/> etc.

 now, hypertext meaning is it is linked to other pages or shows extra information.

 we connecting different pages with each other by clicking on some text it takes you to another page.

 #️⃣ you can render html page using two ways
    1. using your editor
    2. browser

 #️⃣ what is an element ?
    opening tag + content + closing tag ==> element

 #️⃣ two types of text elements
  1. block elements
    - they actually help building the webpage. like <p> tag, <div>, heading tags.

  2. inline elements
    - they are used to modify the text
    e.g. <strong>, <e>, <img/>

    empty tags are self closing tags.
    e.g. <img/>, <br/>, <span></span>

    different tags are 
    1. <h1> to <h6>
    2. <ul>, <ol> lists
    3. <img/>
    4. <div>

    there are also attributes associated with the tags.

    e.g. <img src="" width="" height=""/> here, src is the attribute for img tag which tells the source of image

    #️⃣ id and class attribute

    id -> it is a unique idetifire of an element
    class -> you can give class name to many elements to change the data in bulk.

    ✨ you cannot write block elements in inline elements.

    #️⃣ understanding HTML Doc
    
    1. <!Doctype html>
        it tells that type of document is html
    
    2. <html lang="en">
        the language which we are using is english, the content will be displayed in english.
    
    now inside <html> tag there are two main tags
        - <head></head>
        - <body></body>
    
       i) <head> 
          contains the metadata. what title, style, scripts, etc.
        
       ii) <body>
            contains the content of webpage
    
    3. <meta>
        this tag in defined inside head tag.
        storing info about webpage.
        name="kiran.code.in"
        discription="Learn C++ and DSA in easiest way."

        ❤️ it is used for SEO ❤️ 

        character="UTF-8" ->  it is a character set which we are using in our web page.
        used for character endocing

        our ASCII table works on fixed length bits
        but UTF-8 is variable length. 98% of web pages uses UTF-8.
        it supports too many characters.
    
        - viewport => the display are of your device, width of your device.
        - initial scale = 1.0, when the first time page is loaded.


    #️⃣ tables 

    <table>
    <tr> table row 
    <td> table data
    
    best practice 👇 
    <thead>
    <tbody>
    <tfoot>
    
        e.g.
        Month Salary -> thead (use th tag)
        jan     230
        feb     238  -> tbody
        march   893
        total   --   -> tfoot
