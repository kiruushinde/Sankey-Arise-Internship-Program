Two types 
1. aggregate functions (on many records )
    - count()
    - sum()
    - avg()
    - min()
    - max()

    often used with group by clause, ignores null values except count(*) 
2. scalar functions (works on each record independently)
    - ucase()
    - lcase()
    - mid()
        syntax: mid(col_name, start, length)
        mid(name, 2, 3)
            in column name it will start from 2nd position and will cut the strings upto 3 lengths
        
    - length() 
        returns the length of each value in a column

    - round() --> rounds off the value 
        e.g. round(col_name, 0) {0 indicates the no. of decimal places }
        if 200.32 --> 200 
    
    - now()
        return data nd time 
        select now();
    
    - format()
        format's the current data as 'yyyy-mm-dd'

but, they both returns single value
