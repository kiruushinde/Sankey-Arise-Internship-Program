#️⃣ This is for my new account

$ git push -u origin main
remote: Permission to KiruuShinde01/git-learning-.git denied to kiruushinde.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/KiruuShinde01/git-learning-.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

when I try to push code on github then if it is showing this error, then it means ki you need add SSH key to your account.

how to do that.

1. run this command 
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

2. then make sure ssh agenet is running 
    $ eval $(ssh-agent -s)

3. then run this command 
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

4. now copy the key 
    tail ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

5. This is your new key
