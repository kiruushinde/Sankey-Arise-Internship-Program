There are following types 

✨CSR : Client Side Rendering
✨SSR : Server Side Rendering
✨SSG : Static Site Generation
✨ISR : Incremental Static Regeneration

#️⃣ Build process 

source code --> build --> server --> client (brower)

first the source code is passed to build process, that it the code is stored on to the server. and then sent on to the brower.
e.g. npm run build / dev etc.


✨ CSR : client side Rendering

    Build                        server             client

- the build phase is something where you write the code 
- on the sever all your code is kept seperate and all the html, css and js are kept seperate.
- and now on client side first we send html, and then javascript is sent and as required the js is sent and css is also added.
- this is the core react approach, where everthing will happen through javascript and we sent javascript to the client.

- since empty html page is thrown on client side, it is difficult for search engines. There is no content there, but it is actually created when client visites the page.

- here the web page is rendered/created on client side

✨ Server side Rendering


Build                   Server                  Client 

html              |        🟥🟢           | 
🟥🟥             |         ◻️             ---->    🟥🟢
                  |                         <---      ◻️
JS                |        🟥🟢           |
🟢🟢             |         ◻️             ---->     🟥🟢
                  |                        <----       ◻️
CSS               |                        |
◻️◻️             |        🟥🟢           |
                  |                        |


- here all the html, css and js are loaded on server itself.
- and makes request to the server and on each request new web page is loaded.
- server has more power than the normal browser cause user uses his mobile phone, or laptop which have very limited ram and processign power.
- so, sending everying on server is beneficial as it is expandable too.

✨ SSG : Static Site Generation


Build                        Server                  Client 

                       |        🟥🟢           | 
🟥🟢                  |         ◻️             ---->    🟥🟢
 ⬜                    |                         <---      ◻️
                       |        🟥🟢           |
🟥🟢                  |         ◻️             ---->     🟥🟢
 🔲                    |                        <----       ◻️
                       |                        |
🟥🟢                  |        🟥🟢           |
 ◻️                    |         ⬜            |


here, the html css and javascript are combined together at the time of build only.
hence it takes a lot of time but it is the most efficient way.
creating web pages at build time.

✨ ISR : Incremental Static Regeneration


               Build                Server                  Client

- in SSR we were unable to get the updates quickly, whenever the next phase is build then the updates are pushed.
e.g. let say you want to change some content after every 2 days, and you don't know when the next build phase is, so it is not convinient.

- but, in ISR after every some time the  build phase will happen, so you can get the updated content in real time.
